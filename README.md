# Copernico ðŸ¤”
Copernico is my terminal configuration, based on NvChad and Tmux.
It is currently compatible with MacOS & Linux.

### Main Features
* Previous configuration backup
* Catppuccin theme for Tmux and Neovim
* Syntax highlighting for many languages
* GitHub Copilot preinstalled
* Tmux Plugin Manager preinstalled
* Vim Tmux Navigator preinstalled
* Customized key bindings

### Prerequisites
* neovim
* tmux
* git
* iTerm2 on macOS
* Node.js (GitHub Copilot)

### Set up Copernico
* Install the [JetBrainsMono Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.0.2/JetBrainsMono.zip) and set it as the default terminal font
* Run copernico.py, `python3 copernico.py`
* Finalize installation by entering into neovim, `nvim`
* Run `:Copilot setup` inside neovim to activate GitHub Copilot

### How does it work?
Copernico utilizes a unique approach to minimize updates to our code on every commit
to NvChad. The Live-Patch model lets us maintain a collection of python scripts, instead
of maintaining forks of the relevant repositories. Each script changes specific and targeted
words and lines, contributing to our configuration in a different way. Those scripts are loaded
on runtime from the `patches` directory and can be run individually.
